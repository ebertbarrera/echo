[RUN] One-Click Mega Build — Contract PDF + E-Sign + Notarization + Chat/Export + Dates + Reminders (Single PR, Cost-Guarded)

You are a senior full-stack engineer working in a Next.js App Router monorepo with Supabase.

Goal: Implement the "Lease Execution Bundle" in ONE PR:
A) Contract PDF (unsigned, PH long dates visible in header & clause)
B) E-Sign (embed signature image + name + Manila timestamp; save signed PDF; SHA-256 hash; audit log row)
C) Global date helper formatDateLong('en-PH') + regression test
D) Lease chat (+ attachments), append-only; export PDF + JSON with Manila timestamps and integrity note
E) Notarization helper (fields & file upload), optional gate before lease active OR owner_overridden=true
F) Reminders skeleton: compute T-3/T-1/T0/T+3 vs due day; write audit logs (email stub only)

DB:
- Add columns/tables with RLS:
  - leases: contract_url, contract_hash_sha256, contract_version, signed_contract_url, signed_contract_hash_sha256, signed_at, notarized_url, notarized_at, owner_overridden default false
  - audit_logs: id, user_id, lease_id, action, details jsonb, ip, user_agent, created_at (RLS: user_id = auth.uid() for SELECT)
  - lease_messages: id, lease_id, sender_id, body, attachment_path, message_hash, created_at (RLS: participants-only SELECT/INSERT)
- Storage buckets: contracts, chat-exports (participant-only via Storage RLS or proxy download)

Constraints:
- Commit early and often; keep logs terse to save tokens.
- If time/iterations run low, finish in order A->F and leave concise TODOs.
- Minimal tests (Vitest): date helper; SHA-256; signed hash + audit; chat export; reminder offsets.
- No secrets in code; browser only sees NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY. Service-role only server-side.
- Use /apps/web and /db/migrations. Prefer @react-pdf/renderer; fallback pdfkit.

Deliverables:
- Pages, API routes, migrations, storage rules (or proxy), tests, and a concise PR description with 3-6 small screenshots.
